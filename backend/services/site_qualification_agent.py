LETTER OF INTENT - SOLAR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT

To: Property Owner
Re: {project_name} - Solar Development Opportunity

We are writing to express our intent to lease/acquire rights to develop a solar energy facility at the property located at {address}.

Project Details:
- System Size: {system_size_kw} kW
- Land Requirements: Approximately {round(system_size_kw * 0.01, 1)} acres
- Project Term: 25+ years
- Development Timeline: 12-24 months

This letter represents our preliminary interest and is subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence, permitting, and financing.

We look forward to discussing this opportunity with you.

Sincerely,
Solar Development Team
