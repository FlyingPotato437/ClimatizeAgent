- Interconnection studies: 18–36 months (often the critical path)
- Total development timeline (site control to construction-ready): 3–4 years

Recommendations:
- Begin site control, environmental studies, and CUP application as soon as possible.
- Initiate interconnection application with CAISO/PG&E early, as this is typically the longest process.
- Conduct detailed title, zoning, and environmental diligence to identify any fatal flaws.
- Engage with local stakeholders and agencies early to streamline permitting and address concerns.

All timelines are estimates and may vary based on project specifics, agency workload, and environmental findings. Early and proactive engagement with permitting agencies and the utility is critical to keeping the project on track.
