### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**  
- Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules  
- System losses: 14% (NREL default)  
- Tilt: Latitude (36.99°)  
- Azimuth: 180° (true south)  
- Source: [NREL PVWatts Calculator](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/)

**Annual Generation Estimate:**  
- **System Size:** 48,760 kWac  
- **Estimated Capacity Factor:** 27% (NREL CA single-axis tracking, see [NREL ATB](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2023/utility-scale_pv))  
- **Annual Production:**  
  - 48,760 kWac × 8,760 hr/yr × 0.27 = **115,000,000 kWh/year** (rounded)  
  - *Note: Provided value of 82,845 kWh is inconsistent with system size and likely a typo.*

**Monthly Generation (approximate):**

| Month     | kWh         |
|-----------|-------------|
| January   | 7,800,000   |

| **Total** | **115,000,000** |

**Specific Production:**  
- 115,000,000 kWh / 48,760 kWac = **2,359 kWh/kWac/year**

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Permitting Complexity:** CEQA and county permitting can be lengthy and costly; early engagement with agencies is critical.
- **Grid Capacity:** Hosting capacity and queue congestion in PG&E territory must be confirmed.
- **Land Use:** Urban edge location may increase land cost and community scrutiny.
- **Environmental Diligence:** Wetlands, endangered species, and habitat mapping required.
- **Market Trends:** CA solar PPA prices remain low; REC values stable but not high.
- **Additional Diligence Needed:**  
  - Confirm parcel details, ownership, and title
  - Complete interconnection pre-application with PG&E
  - Engage with local stakeholders and agencies early
