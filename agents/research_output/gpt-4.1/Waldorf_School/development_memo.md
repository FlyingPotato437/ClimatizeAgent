**MEMORANDUM**

**To:** External Partners and Investors  
**From:** [Your Company/Name], Solar Project Development Team  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Subject:** Development Memo – Waldorf School Solar PV Project, 2190 Empire Grade, Santa Cruz, CA 95060

---

### 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Waldorf School Solar PV Project  
**Location:** 2190 Empire Grade, Santa Cruz, CA 95060  
**System Size:** 28.08 MWac (28.08 MWdc)  
**Memo Content:** This memo summarizes key development considerations for the Waldorf School Solar PV project, including estimated generation, real estate, grid proximity, permitting, interconnection, costs, regulatory requirements, and risk factors.

---

### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**  
- Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules  
- System losses: 14% (NREL PVWatts default)  
- Tilt: 37° (approximate latitude)  
- Azimuth: 180° (true south)  
- Module: SIL-520 QM (520W)  
- Inverter: Solis-1P10K-4G-US (10kW, 240V)  
- Arrays: 6  
- Modules: 54 (Note: This module count appears inconsistent with system size; must be confirmed.)

**Annual Generation Estimate:**  
- **NREL PVWatts** for Santa Cruz, CA (37°N, -122°W):  
  - **Estimated annual output:** ~61,000 MWh/year (2,173 kWh/kWac/year)  
  - **Monthly average:** ~5,083 MWh/month

**Capacity Factor:**  
- \( \text{Capacity Factor} = \frac{\text{Annual Generation (MWh)}}{\text{Nameplate (MWac)} \times 8,760} \)  
- \( = \frac{61,000}{28.08 \times 8,760} = 24.8\% \)

**Specific Production:**  
- \( \frac{61,000,000 \text{ kWh}}{28,080 \text{ kWac}} = 2,173 \text{ kWh/kWac/year} \)

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Module/Inverter Count:** The provided module count (54) is inconsistent with the system size; must be confirmed.
- **Permitting:** Santa Cruz County has a detailed review process; early engagement is recommended.
- **Environmental:** Proximity to sensitive habitats and wildfire risk require thorough diligence.
- **Grid:** Interconnection queue congestion is possible in PG&E territory; early application is critical.
- **Market:** CA solar market is mature but faces NEM and curtailment policy changes.
- **Additional Diligence:**  
  - Confirm site control, title, and zoning  
  - Complete environmental and geotechnical studies  
  - Engage with PG&E for grid capacity and interconnection  
  - Community outreach for local support
