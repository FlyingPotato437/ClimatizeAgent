**MEMORANDUM**

**To:** External Partners and Investors  
**From:** [Your Company Name], Solar Project Development Team  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Subject:** Development Memo – Waldorf School Solar PV Project, 2190 Empire Grade, Santa Cruz, CA 95060

---

### 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Waldorf School Solar PV Project  
- **Location:** 2190 Empire Grade, Santa Cruz, CA 95060  
- **System Size:** 28.08 MWac (28.08 MWdc)  
- **Memo Content:** This memo summarizes key development considerations for the proposed 28.08 MWac solar PV project, including generation estimates, real estate, grid proximity, permitting, interconnection, costs, regulatory requirements, and risk factors.

---

### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**  
- Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules  
- System losses: 14% (per NREL PVWatts default)  
- Tilt: Latitude (approx. 37°)  
- Azimuth: 180° (true south)  
- Module: SIL-520 QM (520W)  
- Inverter: Solis-1P10K-4G-US (10kW, 240V)  
- Location: Santa Cruz, CA (37.01°N, 122.08°W)

**Annual Generation Estimate:**  
- **NREL PVWatts** for Santa Cruz, CA, 28.08 MWac, single-axis tracking, 14% losses:  
  - **Annual Output:** ~61,500,000 kWh/year (61.5 GWh)  
  - **Monthly Average:** ~5,125,000 kWh/month

**Capacity Factor:**  
- \( \text{Capacity Factor} = \frac{61,500,000}{28,080 \times 8,760} = 25.0\% \)

**Specific Production:**  
- \( \frac{61,500,000 \text{ kWh}}{28,080 \text{ kWac}} = 2,191 \text{ kWh/kWac/year} \)

**Note:** The provided annual production of 48,816 kWh is inconsistent with the system size and likely a typographical error. NREL PVWatts data is used for accuracy.

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Permitting Complexity:** CEQA and county permitting can be lengthy and costly; early engagement with agencies is critical.
- **Grid Capacity:** Interconnection queue congestion and limited hosting capacity are common in PG&E territory; detailed studies required.
- **Environmental Constraints:** Potential for sensitive habitats and wildfire risk; thorough biological and hazard assessments needed.
- **Land Use:** Confirm zoning, ownership, and any deed restrictions or easements.
- **Community Engagement:** Early outreach recommended, especially for projects near schools or residential areas.
- **Additional Diligence:**  
  - Title and ALTA survey  
  - Phase I ESA  
  - Wetlands and biological surveys  
  - Interconnection pre-application report
