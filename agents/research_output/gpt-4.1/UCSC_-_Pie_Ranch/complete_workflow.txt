### 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name:** UCSC – Pie Ranch Solar PV Project  
- **Location:** Kearny Street, Monterey County, CA 93933  
- **System Size:** 29.57 MWac (29.57 MWdc)  
- **Technology:** Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules (JAM72S10-405PR)  
- **Inverters:** SE33.3KUS (480V, 33.3 kW)  
- **Arrays:** 3  
- **Modules:** 73 (Note: Module count appears inconsistent with system size; must be confirmed)  
- **Memo Content:** This memo summarizes project generation estimates, real estate status, grid proximity, permitting, interconnection, costs, market context, and key risks for the UCSC Pie Ranch Solar PV Project.

---

### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**  
- Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules  
- System losses: 14% (per NREL PVWatts default)  
- Tilt: Latitude (~36.7°)  
- Azimuth: 180° (true south)  
- Location: Monterey County, CA

**Annual Generation Estimate:**  
- **Capacity Factor (CF):**  
  - NREL ATB (2023) for CA, utility-scale PV, single-axis tracking: ~28%  
  - [NREL ATB 2023](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2023/index)  
- **Annual Generation:**  
  - 29.57 MWac × 8,760 hr/yr × 28% CF ≈ **72,400,000 kWh/year (72.4 GWh/year)**
- **Monthly Generation:**  
  - Average: 72,400,000 kWh / 12 ≈ **6,033,000 kWh/month**  
  - (Monthly variation: ~60–120% of average, depending on season)
- **Specific Production:**  
  - 72,400,000 kWh / 29,570 kWac ≈ **2,450 kWh/kWac/year**

**Note:** The provided annual production figure (48,913 kWh) is inconsistent with system size and likely a typo. Above estimates use industry-standard methodology.

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Permitting Complexity:** CEQA review and potential for environmental constraints (habitat, wetlands) may extend timelines.
- **Interconnection Queue:** CAISO/PG&E queues are active; delays possible.
- **Module Count Discrepancy:** Provided module count (73) is inconsistent with system size; must be confirmed.
- **Land Control:** Parcel ID, acreage, and title status must be confirmed.
- **Community Engagement:** Early outreach recommended to mitigate opposition.
- **Market Trends:** CA solar market remains robust, but NEM and wholesale price reforms may impact economics.
- **Additional Diligence:**  
  - Confirm site control and legal encumbrances  
  - Detailed environmental and grid studies  
  - Updated cost and schedule estimates as project advances
