### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**  
- Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules  
- System losses: 14% (NREL PVWatts default)  
- Tilt: Latitude (~36°)  
- Azimuth: 180° (South)  
- Location: Monterey County, CA

**Annual Generation Estimate:**  
- **PVWatts/NREL estimate for Monterey County:**  
  - **Capacity Factor:** ~27% (NREL PVWatts, single-axis tracking, Monterey, CA)  
  - **Annual Generation:**  
    - 29.57 MWac × 8,760 hr × 0.27 = **69,998,964 kWh/year (~70,000 MWh/year)**
    - **Monthly Average:** ~5,833,247 kWh/month

**Specific Production:**  
- **kWh/kWac/year:** 70,000,000 kWh / 29,570 kWac = **2,368 kWh/kWac/year**

| Land Cost/Control  | 7            | Rural, but must confirm site specifics     |
| Community Support  | 7            | No known opposition, but diligence needed  |
| Environmental Risk | 6            | Wetlands/habitat must be confirmed         |
| **Average**        | **6.8**      |                                            |

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Permitting Complexity:** CEQA and county permitting can be lengthy and costly; early engagement with agencies is critical.
- **Interconnection Queue:** CAISO and PG&E queues are congested; risk of long timelines or high upgrade costs.
- **Environmental Constraints:** Wetlands, endangered species, and agricultural land conversion require diligence.
- **Module Count Discrepancy:** The stated module count (73) is inconsistent with system size; must be confirmed.
- **Market Volatility:** REC and merchant rates fluctuate; long-term offtake agreements recommended.
- **Additional Diligence:**  
  - Confirm site control, zoning, and parcel data  
  - Complete environmental screening (wetlands, habitat, cultural resources)  
  - Engage utility for grid studies and hosting capacity  
  - Community outreach to preempt opposition
