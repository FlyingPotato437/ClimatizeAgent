### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**  
- Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules  
- System losses: 14% (NREL PVWatts default)  
- Tilt: 36° (Aptos latitude)  
- Azimuth: 180° (true south)  
- Source: [NREL PVWatts Calculator](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/)

| Parameter                | Value                |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Nameplate Capacity       | 11,200 kWac          |
| Annual Production        | ~22,000,000 kWh      |
| Monthly Avg. Production  | ~1,833,000 kWh       |
| Capacity Factor          | ~22.4%               |
| Specific Production      | ~1,964 kWh/kWac/yr   |

**Notes:**  
- The provided annual production (17,926 kWh) appears to be a typo or per-module value. For 11.2 MWac in Aptos, CA, annual production is typically 1,900–2,000 kWh/kWac/year ([NREL ATB](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2023/index)).
- Monthly generation varies seasonally; see [PVWatts output](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php) for detailed breakdown.

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Local Issues:**  
  - Santa Cruz County has strict land use and environmental review processes; CEQA compliance is required.
  - Coastal zone proximity may trigger additional review.
  - Community engagement is critical; local opposition possible.
- **Regional Trends:**  
  - Grid congestion and limited hosting capacity in PG&E territory.
  - Increasing scrutiny on land use, especially near sensitive habitats.
- **Additional Diligence Needed:**  
  - Confirm site control, zoning, and environmental constraints.
  - Complete interconnection pre-application with PG&E.
  - Engage with local stakeholders early.
  - Detailed title and environmental studies.
