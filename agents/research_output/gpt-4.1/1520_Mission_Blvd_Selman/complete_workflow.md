### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**  
- Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules  
- System losses: 14%  
- Tilt: Latitude (36.97°)  
- Azimuth: 180° (true south)  
- Source: [NREL PVWatts Calculator](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/)

**Annual Generation Estimate:**  
- **Capacity:** 17,490 kWac  
- **Estimated Annual Production:** ~38,000,000 kWh (38 GWh)  
  - *Note: The provided figure of 26,912 kWh is inconsistent with system size and likely a typo.*

**Monthly Generation (approximate):**

| Month | kWh      |
|-------|----------|
| Jan   | 2,400,000|
| Feb   | 2,800,000|
| Mar   | 3,400,000|
| Apr   | 3,800,000|
| May   | 4,000,000|
| Jun   | 4,200,000|
| Jul   | 4,300,000|
| Aug   | 4,100,000|
| Sep   | 3,800,000|
| Oct   | 3,200,000|
| Nov   | 2,600,000|

**Capacity Factor:**  
- **CF = Annual Output / (Capacity × 8760) = 38,000,000 / (17,490 × 8,760) ≈ 24.8%**

**Specific Production:**  
- **2,172 kWh/kWac/year**

---

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Grid Constraints:** Urban/suburban grid may have limited hosting capacity; detailed utility study required.
- **Permitting Complexity:** CEQA and local opposition can extend timelines.
- **Land Use:** Urban land may be costly or have competing uses; confirm site control and zoning.
- **Environmental Review:** Sensitive habitats possible; early biological and wetlands surveys recommended.
- **Market Trends:** CA solar market is mature but faces curtailment and declining PPA prices.
- **Additional Diligence:**  
  - Confirm parcel details, zoning, and ownership  
  - Complete interconnection pre-application  
  - Engage with local stakeholders early  
  - Conduct full environmental and geotechnical studies
