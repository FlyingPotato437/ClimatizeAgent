### 2. Estimated Generation

- **Annual Production:** 87,180 kWh *(as provided; see note below)*
- **Monthly Production:** 7,265 kWh (average)
- **Capacity Factor:**  
  \[
  \text{Capacity Factor} = \frac{\text{Annual Production (kWh)}}{\text{Nameplate Capacity (kWac)} \times 8760}
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{87,180}{52,480 \times 8,760} \approx 0.19\%
  \]
  *Note: This value is anomalously low for a project of this size. Typical annual production for a 52.48 MWac system in Napa, CA, with single-axis tracking and 14% losses, is approximately 110,000–120,000 MWh (110–120 GWh). Please confirm the annual production figure.*

- **Estimated Typical Generation (NREL PVWatts, Napa, CA):**
  - **Annual:** ~110,000,000 kWh (110 GWh)
  - **Monthly:** ~9,167,000 kWh (average)
  - **Capacity Factor:** ~24% (typical for Napa, CA, with tracking)

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Land Use:** Napa County is known for strict land use controls, especially regarding agricultural and scenic lands. Early engagement with county planning is critical.
- **Grid Capacity:** Proximity to adequate grid infrastructure must be confirmed; PG&E’s hosting capacity and CAISO queue congestion are potential risks.
- **Environmental:** Potential for sensitive habitat, wetlands, and wildfire risk; comprehensive studies required.
- **Permitting:** Napa County process is thorough and may require public hearings.
- **Market:** California remains a strong solar market, but interconnection and land costs are rising.
- **Additional Diligence Required:**  
  - Confirm annual production estimates and system design.
  - Title search and parcel data.
  - Detailed grid study and interconnection pre-application.
  - Community outreach and stakeholder engagement.
