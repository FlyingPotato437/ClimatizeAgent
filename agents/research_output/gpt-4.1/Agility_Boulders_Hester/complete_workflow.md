### 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Agility Boulders (Hester)  
**Location:** 1404 38th Ave, Santa Cruz, CA 95062  
**System Size:** 15.6 MWac (15.6 MWdc)  
**Technology:** Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules (SIL-520 QM, 520W), Enphase IQ8H-208-72-2-US inverters  
**Memo Content:** This memo summarizes key development factors for the proposed 15.6 MWac solar PV project, including generation estimates, real estate, grid access, permitting, costs, and risk factors.

### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**  
- Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules  
- System losses: 14%  
- Tilt: 36° (Santa Cruz latitude)  
- Azimuth: 180° (true south)  
- Source: [NREL PVWatts Calculator](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/)

**Annual Solar Resource (Santa Cruz, CA):**  
- GHI: ~5.3 kWh/m²/day ([NREL Data](https://maps.nrel.gov/nsrdb-viewer/))

**Estimated Annual Generation:**  
- **Capacity:** 15,600 kWac  
- **Capacity Factor:** ~27% (single-axis tracking, CA coastal, per [NREL ATB](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2023/index))  
- **Annual Generation:**  
  - 15,600 kW × 8,760 hr × 0.27 = **36,872,880 kWh/year**  
- **Monthly Generation:**  
  - Average: 3,073,000 kWh/month (seasonal variation ±20%)  
- **Specific Production:**  
  - 36,872,880 kWh / 15,600 kWac = **2,364 kWh/kWac/year**

**Note:** The provided annual production figure (24,143 kWh) appears to be a typo or per-module value. The above estimate is based on system size and regional resource.

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Land Cost:** Santa Cruz County has high land values; site control costs may be significant.
- **Environmental Review:** Proximity to sensitive habitats and wetlands likely; detailed biological and hydrological studies required.
- **Permitting Timeline:** California permitting is comprehensive; expect 18+ months for full approvals.
- **Grid Congestion:** PG&E territory has active interconnection queues; early engagement is critical.
- **Community Engagement:** Local support is generally positive for renewables, but NIMBY concerns possible.
- **Additional Diligence Needed:**  
  - Confirm parcel ownership, acreage, and zoning  
  - Complete environmental site assessments  
  - Obtain utility pre-application report for grid proximity and hosting  
  - Engage with County Planning for early feedback
