### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**  
- Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules  
- System losses: 14%  
- Tilt: Latitude (37.34°)  
- Azimuth: 180° (true south)

**Resource Data:**

| **Total**          | **9/12**    | Favorable, with moderate permitting/grid caveats    |

**Favorability Index:** **7.5/10**

---

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Permitting Complexity:** CEQA and local CUP can extend timelines; early engagement with agencies recommended.
- **Grid Congestion:** Urban grid may have limited hosting capacity; review ICA and CAISO queue.
- **Land Cost:** Urban/industrial land is higher cost; site control diligence required.
- **Environmental Review:** Confirm no sensitive habitat or wetlands; CNDDB and NWI review needed.
- **Market Trends:** CA solar market remains robust, but interconnection and permitting are key bottlenecks.
- **Additional Diligence:**  
  - Title and ALTA survey  
  - Detailed grid study  
  - Community outreach  
  - Confirm all environmental constraints
