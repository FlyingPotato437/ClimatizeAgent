### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Grid Congestion:** High interconnection queue activity in CA; delays possible.  
- **Permitting:** CEQA can extend timelines; early engagement recommended.  
- **Land Use:** Urban/suburban location may increase cost and complexity.  
- **Environmental:** Confirm absence of wetlands, endangered species, and floodplain.  
- **Market:** CA solar PPA prices remain competitive; REC values moderate.  
- **Additional Diligence Needed:**  
  - Title and zoning confirmation  
  - Detailed grid study  
  - Environmental site assessment  
  - Community engagement
