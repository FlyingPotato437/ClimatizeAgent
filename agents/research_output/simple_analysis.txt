- Total project timeline (development to commissioning): 24–36 months

Recommendations:
- Begin site control, environmental studies, and agency engagement as early as possible.
- Confirm zoning and parcel details with the County and City.
- Initiate interconnection pre-application with PG&E/CAISO in parallel with permitting.
- Conduct environmental due diligence to determine if wetlands or wildlife permits are needed.
- Prepare a decommissioning plan for permit applications.
- Engage with local agencies early to clarify requirements and streamline review.

All costs and timelines are estimates and should be confirmed with the relevant agencies. Early and parallel processing of permits and interconnection is critical to minimizing project delays.
