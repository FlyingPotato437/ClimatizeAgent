| Metric                        | Value                |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Nameplate Capacity (MWac)     | 15.60                |
| Estimated Annual Generation   | 34,000,000 kWh       |
| Estimated Monthly Generation  | 2,833,000 kWh (avg.) |

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Grid Constraints:** Hosting capacity in Santa Cruz is limited; detailed interconnection study required.
- **Permitting:** CEQA review can be lengthy and costly; early engagement with County and environmental consultants is critical.
- **Land Cost:** High land values in Santa Cruz may impact project economics.
- **Environmental Sensitivity:** Potential for wetlands or endangered species; thorough biological and hydrological studies needed.
- **Community Engagement:** Urban proximity increases risk of opposition; proactive outreach recommended.
- **Market:** California remains a strong solar market with robust RPS and REC demand.
- **Additional Diligence:**  
  - Confirm parcel ownership, zoning, and title.
  - Complete detailed site and grid studies.
  - Engage with PG&E and Santa Cruz County early.
