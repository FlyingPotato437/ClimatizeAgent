### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **CEQA/Permitting:** California’s CEQA process can be lengthy and costly; early engagement with County Planning is critical.
- **Grid Capacity:** Confirming available hosting capacity at nearest PG&E substation is essential; interconnection queue congestion is possible.
- **Land Use:** Zoning and title review required to confirm suitability and absence of restrictions.
- **Environmental:** Wetlands, endangered species, and habitat constraints must be assessed via field studies and agency consultation.
- **Market Trends:** California remains a strong solar market, but interconnection and permitting timelines are increasing.
- **Additional Diligence:**  
  - Title and ALTA survey  
  - Wetlands and biological field surveys  
  - Pre-application meeting with PG&E  
  - Community outreach
