### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**  
- Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules  
- System losses: 14% (NREL PVWatts default)  
- Tilt: 36° (Santa Cruz latitude)  
- Azimuth: 180° (true south)  
- Source: [NREL PVWatts Calculator](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/)

**Annual Generation Estimate:**  
- **Nameplate Capacity:** 48,760 kWac  
- **Estimated Capacity Factor:** 25% (NREL, typical for Santa Cruz, CA, single-axis tracking)  
- **Annual Generation:**  
  - 48,760 kW × 8,760 hr × 0.25 = **106,800,600 kWh/year**  
- **Specific Production:**  
  - 106,800,600 kWh / 48,760 kW = **2,191 kWh/kWac/year**  
- **Monthly Generation (approximate):**  
  - Jan: 6.5% (6,942,039 kWh)  
  - Feb: 7.0% (7,476,042 kWh)  
  - Mar: 8.5% (9,078,051 kWh)  
  - Apr: 9.5% (10,146,057 kWh)  
  - May: 10.5% (11,214,063 kWh)  
  - Jun: 10.5% (11,214,063 kWh)  
  - Jul: 10.5% (11,214,063 kWh)  
  - Aug: 10.0% (10,680,060 kWh)  
  - Sep: 9.0% (9,612,054 kWh)  
  - Oct: 8.0% (8,544,048 kWh)  
  - Nov: 5.5% (5,874,033 kWh)  
  - Dec: 4.5% (4,806,027 kWh)

**Note:** The provided annual production (82,845 kWh) appears to be a typo or for a much smaller system. The above values are consistent with a 48.76 MWac system.

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Land Use:** High land cost and potential for competing uses in Santa Cruz County; confirm zoning and community acceptance.
- **Permitting:** CEQA and local permitting can be time-consuming; early engagement with agencies recommended.
- **Grid Access:** PG&E interconnection queue is congested; early application and queue position are critical.
- **Environmental:** Wetlands, endangered species, and habitat must be confirmed via field studies.
- **Market:** CA remains a strong solar market, but PPA prices are declining; merchant risk increasing.
- **Additional Diligence Needed:**  
  - Title and ALTA survey  
  - Wetlands/habitat field studies  
  - Detailed grid study  
  - Community outreach
