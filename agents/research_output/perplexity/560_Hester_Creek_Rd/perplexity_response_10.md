## Retail Rate Analysis  
**Average residential electricity rates** in PG&E territory (serving 560 Hester Creek Rd) average **32.8¢/kWh** for residential customers, significantly above the U.S. average of 16.1¢/kWh[1][2].  

**Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing** follows PG&E’s E-TOU-C rate structure:  
- **Peak (4 PM–9 PM, summer)**: 62¢/kWh  
- **Off-peak**: 24¢/kWh  
- **Winter rates** are 15% lower than summer peaks[1][3].  

**Net Energy Metering (NEM 3.0)** compensates exports at **avoided-cost rates** (5–8¢/kWh), down from retail rates under prior policies[1][4].  

**Rate escalation** averages **4.2% annually** (CPUC 2023–2025 forecasts), driven by wildfire mitigation and grid upgrades[2][4].

## Utility Rate Structure  
**PG&E (investor-owned utility)** dominates the region, with rates **40% higher** than U.S. IOUs[1][3]. Key features:  
- **Demand charges**: None for residential <20 kW  
- **Interconnection fee**: $145 for systems ≤30 kW  
- **Renewable incentives**: $0.02/kWh for SGIP-eligible storage (not applicable here)[3][4].  

**Seasonal variations**: Summer rates exceed winter by 25% due to cooling demand[1].

## Market Comparison  
| **Rate Benchmark**       | ¢/kWh |  
|---------------------------|--------|  
| PG&E residential          | 32.8   |  
| California average        | 29.4   |  
| U.S. average              | 16.1   |  
| Neighboring SCE territory | 31.2   |  

California ranks **#3 nationally for residential rates**, trailing only Hawaii and Massachusetts[1][2].

## Regulatory Environment  
**CPUC rate-setting** prioritizes:  
- **Wildfire cost recovery** (adding 8–12% to bills)  
- **100% RPS by 2045**, accelerating renewable adoption  
- **Distributed generation value**: CPUC’s 2024 VOS study values residential solar at **$0.22/kWh** (vs. retail $0.33)[4].  

**NEM 3.0** reduces export compensation but adds storage incentives to align generation with peak demand[3][4].

## Economic Analysis  
**Value of Solar (VOS)** for this project:  
- **Avoided energy cost**: $7,200/year (22,492 kWh × $0.32/kWh)  
- **Capacity value**: $1,100/year (based on CAISO 2024 capacity prices)  
- **Ancillary services**: Not monetized at this scale  

**Long-term rate forecast**:  
- **Conservative**: 3.5% annual escalation  
- **Moderate**: 4.5% (CPUC baseline)  
- **High**: 6.0% (grid hardening scenarios)[2][4].  

---

## Customer Segment Analysis  
**Target profile**: Residential owner with high consumption (134% offset).  
**Behind-the-meter value**:  
- **Bill savings**: $1,800/year (Year 1)  
- **PPA benchmark**: $0.18–$0.22/kWh for residential solar in PG&E territory  
- **Competitive position**: Outperforms grid purchases by 42% given current rates[1][3].

### Data Sources  
1. **EIA Electric Power Monthly** (June 2025)  
2. **CPUC 2024 Rate Case Filings** (PG&E GRC)  
3. **CAISO 2024 Market Reports**  
4. **CPUC NEM 3.0 Decision** (D.23-08-024)  

This analysis confirms strong ROI driven by high retail rates and favorable site economics, though NEM 3.0 reduces export revenue potential. Conservative escalation models still project 12-year payback.
