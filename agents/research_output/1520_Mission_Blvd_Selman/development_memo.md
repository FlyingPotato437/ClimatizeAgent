### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Local Issues:**  
  - Santa Cruz County has strict land use and environmental review processes (CEQA).
  - Potential for sensitive habitat or wetlands on/near site.
  - Land cost and availability may be challenging.
- **Regional Trends:**  
  - High interconnection queue congestion in PG&E territory.
  - Increasing scrutiny of large-scale solar in coastal California.
- **Additional Diligence Required:**  
  - Confirm parcel ownership, zoning, and environmental constraints.
  - Detailed grid study to confirm hosting capacity and upgrade costs.
  - Early community engagement recommended.
