| **Section 401 Water Quality Cert. (EPA)**   | Maybe                | Required if Section 404 applies; triggers if discharges to state waters occur.                                 |
| **USFWS ESA/Wildlife Permit**               | Maybe                | Needed if endangered species/habitat present; CNDDB and site survey required to confirm.                      |
| **CEQA Review**                             | Yes                  | All discretionary permits in CA require CEQA; triggered by CUP application.                                    |
| **Building/Electrical Permits**             | Yes                  | Required for construction; issued by City of San Jose after CUP/CEQA.                                          |
| **Grading Permit**                          | Maybe                | Required if significant earthwork; likely for utility-scale solar.                                             |
| **Encroachment Permit**                     | Maybe                | Needed if work in public ROW (e.g., utility tie-in, access roads).                                             |
| **Fire Department Approval**                | Yes                  | Required for site access, fire code compliance; part of building permit process.                               |

| **Decommissioning Plan/Bond**               | Maybe                | Not currently required by County, but may be imposed as CUP condition.                                         |

### Notes on "Maybe" Permits:
- **USACE 404/401/USFWS:** Site-specific environmental constraints (wetlands, endangered species) must be confirmed via field studies and database review.
- **Grading/Encroachment:** Confirmed by final site design and utility tie-in plans.
- **Decommissioning:** Not a formal permit, but a plan may be required as a CUP condition.

---

## 2. Permit Priority Sequence

**Order of Permitting Activities:**

1. **Conditional Use Permit (CUP)**
   - Initiate immediately; triggers CEQA review.
2. **FAA Permit (Form 7460-1)**
   - Submit online; can be done in parallel with CUP.
3. **Environmental Permits (USACE 404/401, USFWS)**
   - If triggered, initiate in parallel with CUP/CEQA.
4. **CEQA Review**
   - Runs concurrently with CUP; required for CUP approval.
5. **State/County Specific Permits**
   - Grading, encroachment, stormwater (NPDES), fire department—initiate after CUP/CEQA, but prep can begin earlier.
6. **PG&E Interconnection Agreement**
   - Separate track; initiate early due to long timelines.
7. **Building/Electrical Permits**
   - Apply after CUP/CEQA approval and final design.
8. **Decommissioning Plan**
   - Submit as part of CUP application if required.

---

## 3. Critical Path Analysis

### **Permits/Processes That Can Be Pursued in Parallel:**
- **CUP Application & CEQA Review:** These are linked and proceed together.
- **FAA Permit:** Can be submitted immediately; does not depend on local approvals.
- **Environmental Permits (USACE, EPA, USFWS):** If needed, can be initiated as soon as environmental studies indicate potential triggers.
- **PG&E Interconnection Process:** Should be started early and runs independently of land use permitting.
- **Preliminary Engineering/Design:** Can proceed in parallel to support permit applications.

### **Permits/Processes That Are Sequential:**
- **Building/Electrical Permits:** Must wait for CUP/CEQA approval and final design.
- **Grading/Encroachment Permits:** Typically require CUP/CEQA approval and final engineering.
- **Construction:** Cannot begin until all above permits are secured.

### **Summary Table:**

## 4. Risk Assessment

### **Highest Risk Permits (Potential for Delay or Rejection):**

1. **CEQA Review (Triggered by CUP)**
   - **Risk:** High. CEQA can uncover significant environmental impacts (e.g., wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources) that require mitigation, redesign, or can even halt the project.
   - **Mitigation:** Early, thorough environmental due diligence; consult with agencies; robust documentation.

2. **USACE Section 404/401 & USFWS ESA Permits**
   - **Risk:** Moderate to High if wetlands or listed species are present. Can require lengthy studies, mitigation, or redesign.
   - **Mitigation:** Early site screening (wetlands, CNDDB, field surveys); avoid sensitive areas if possible.

3. **PG&E Interconnection Agreement**
   - **Risk:** Moderate. Grid capacity constraints or queue delays can impact project viability or timeline.
   - **Mitigation:** Early engagement with PG&E; pre-application studies; flexibility in interconnection location.

4. **Conditional Use Permit (CUP)**
   - **Risk:** Moderate. Public opposition, zoning conflicts, or political issues can delay or block approval.
   - **Mitigation:** Community outreach; confirm zoning; address concerns proactively.

5. **Building/Electrical Permits**
   - **Risk:** Low to Moderate. Delays possible if plans are incomplete or code issues arise, but generally routine after CUP/CEQA.

### **Lower Risk Permits:**
- **FAA Permit:** Low risk; rarely blocks projects unless near airports or exceeding height limits.
- **Stormwater/NPDES, Grading, Encroachment:** Routine if plans are compliant.

## 5. Actionable Recommendations

1. **Initiate CUP and CEQA Review Immediately:** These are the gating items for all subsequent permits.
2. **Conduct Thorough Environmental Due Diligence:** Early wetland delineation, habitat surveys, and CNDDB review to identify and mitigate environmental risks.
3. **Submit FAA Form 7460-1 Early:** No cost, quick process, and can be done in parallel.
4. **Engage PG&E for Interconnection Pre-Application:** Confirm grid capacity and queue status ASAP.
5. **Prepare for Environmental Permits:** If wetlands or listed species are present, initiate USACE/USFWS consultations in parallel with CUP/CEQA.
6. **Develop a Decommissioning Plan:** Include with CUP application to preempt potential county requirements.
7. **Plan for Community Outreach:** Address potential public concerns early to reduce CUP risk.
8. **Sequence Construction Permits:** Prepare building, grading, and stormwater permit packages during CUP/CEQA review so they can be submitted immediately upon approval.
