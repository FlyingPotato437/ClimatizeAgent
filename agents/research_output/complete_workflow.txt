### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Grid Congestion:** High interconnection queue activity in Santa Clara County; delays possible.
- **Land Use:** Urban/suburban land may have higher costs, more complex title/easement issues.
- **Permitting:** Multiple overlapping jurisdictions; early agency engagement recommended.
- **Environmental:** Confirm absence of wetlands, endangered species, or hazardous materials.
- **Market:** REC and PPA prices have declined; merchant risk increasing.
- **Additional Diligence Needed:**  
  - Confirm parcel ownership, zoning, and title  
  - Detailed grid study (ICA, SIS)  
  - Community engagement and outreach  
  - Updated cost estimates as market conditions evolve
