### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**  
- **Module:** SIL-440 QD (440W), bifacial, single-axis tracking  
- **System Losses:** 14% (per NREL PVWatts default)  
- **Tilt:** 36° (approximate latitude of Aptos, CA)  
- **Azimuth:** 180° (true south)  
- **Annual GHI:** ~5.3 kWh/m²/day (NREL NSRDB, [source](https://maps.nrel.gov/nsrdb-viewer/))

**Annual Generation Calculation:**  
- **Capacity Factor Estimate:**  
  - NREL PVWatts for Santa Cruz County, CA, single-axis tracking, 14% losses: ~27%  
  - [NREL PVWatts Calculator](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/)

- **Annual Generation:**  
  - 21.12 MWac × 8,760 hr × 27% = **50,000,000 kWh/year** (rounded)  
  - *Note: The provided figure of 35,282 kWh is inconsistent with system size and likely a typo.*

- **Monthly Generation:**  
  - Average: 4,166,667 kWh/month (seasonal variation ±15–20%)

- **Specific Production:**  
  - 50,000,000 kWh / 21,120 kWac = **2,367 kWh/kWac/year**

|--------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Solar Resource     | 8            | Good, but not highest in CA                       |
| Permitting         | 6            | County process, environmental diligence required   |
| Grid Access        | 5            | Substation proximity, but high queue/congestion    |
| Land Cost/Use      | 7            | Institutional land, but must confirm compatibility |
| Community Support  | 7            | Church project, but local review needed            |
| Overall            | **6.6**      | Favorable, but grid and permitting are challenges  |

---

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Grid Congestion:** High interconnection queue in PG&E territory; hosting capacity may be limited.
- **Permitting Complexity:** Santa Cruz County has robust environmental review; wetlands/habitat diligence required.
- **Land Use Compatibility:** Institutional land may require zoning variance or CUP.
- **Market Trends:** CA solar PPA prices are declining; REC prices stable but not high.
- **Additional Diligence Needed:**  
  - Confirm parcel ownership, zoning, and title  
  - Complete environmental and grid studies  
  - Engage with community stakeholders early
