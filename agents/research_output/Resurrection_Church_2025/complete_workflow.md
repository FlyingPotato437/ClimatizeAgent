### 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Resurrection Church Solar PV Project (2025)
- **Location:** 7600 Soquel Dr, Aptos, CA 95003
- **System Size:** 21.12 MWac (21.12 MWdc)
- **Memo Content:** This memo summarizes key development aspects including generation estimates, real estate, grid proximity, permitting, interconnection, costs, market context, and risk factors for the proposed solar PV project.

---

### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**
- **Module:** SIL-440 QD (440W), bifacial, single-axis tracking
- **System Losses:** 14% (NREL PVWatts default)
- **Tilt:** 36° (Aptos latitude)
- **Azimuth:** 180° (South)
- **Annual Solar Irradiance:** ~1,900 kWh/m²/yr (NREL NSRDB, [source](https://maps.nrel.gov/nsrdb-viewer/))
- **Capacity Factor Calculation:**

  \[
  \text{Annual Generation (kWh)} = \text{Nameplate (kWac)} \times \text{Capacity Factor} \times 8760
  \]
  \[
  \text{Capacity Factor} = \frac{\text{Annual Generation}}{\text{Nameplate} \times 8760}
  \]

**Estimated Annual Generation:**  
- **PVWatts Estimate:** For Santa Cruz County, single-axis tracking, 21.12 MWac, 14% losses:  
  - **Annual Generation:** ~46,000,000 kWh (46 GWh)  
  - **Monthly Average:** ~3,833,000 kWh  
  - **Capacity Factor:** ~24.8%  
  - **Specific Production:** ~2,178 kWh/kWac/year

**Note:** The provided annual production (35,282 kWh) appears to be a typo or miscalculation. For a 21.12 MWac system, expected annual output is 45–50 GWh. Please confirm.

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Grid Constraints:** PG&E territory is congested; interconnection upgrades and long queue times are likely.
- **Permitting Complexity:** CEQA and local CUP processes can be lengthy and require robust environmental review.
- **Land Use:** Confirm site control, zoning compatibility, and absence of deed restrictions.
- **Environmental:** Wetlands, sensitive species, and stormwater management may require mitigation.
- **Market:** California remains a strong solar market, but NEM and wholesale market reforms are ongoing.
- **Additional Diligence Needed:**  
  - Confirm parcel size, ownership, and title
  - Detailed grid study and ICA review
  - Full environmental site assessment
  - Community engagement plan
