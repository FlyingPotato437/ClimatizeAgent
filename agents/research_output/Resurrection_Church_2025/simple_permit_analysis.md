# Solar Project Permit Analysis

**Project Address:** 7600 Soquel Dr, Aptos, CA 95003
**System Size:** 21.12 MWac

## Analysis

For a 21.12 MWac solar project at 7600 Soquel Dr, Aptos, CA 95003, you will need the following major permits and approvals:

1. Conditional Use Permit (CUP)
   - Agency: Santa Cruz County Planning Department
   - Timeline: 6–12 months

2. FAA Permit (Form 7460-1)
   - Agency: Federal Aviation Administration
   - Timeline: 1–2 months
   - Notes: Required if structures exceed certain heights or are near airports.

3. Nationwide Permit (Section 404, Clean Water Act)
   - Agency: US Army Corps of Engineers
   - Timeline: 3–6 months
   - Notes: Needed if wetlands or waters of the US are impacted.

4. Wetlands Permit
   - Agency: US Army Corps of Engineers / EPA
   - Timeline: 3–6 months
   - Notes: May be combined with Section 404, depending on site conditions.

5. Wildlife Permit

7. Interconnection Approval
   - Agencies: PG&E (utility), CAISO (if transmission-level)
   - Timeline: 12–18 months (studies can overlap with other permitting)
   - Notes: Includes Feasibility, System Impact, and Facilities Studies.

8. Decommissioning Plan Approval
   - Agency: Santa Cruz County
   - Timeline: Included in CUP process
   - Notes: Financial assurance (bond/escrow) required.

Estimated Overall Timeline:
- Permitting (including environmental review): 12–18 months
- Interconnection studies: 12–18 months (can overlap with permitting)
- Total pre-construction development (including site control, due diligence, permitting, and interconnection): 24–36 months

Recommendations:
- Begin with site control and initiate environmental studies immediately.
- Engage with Santa Cruz County Planning early to clarify zoning and CUP requirements.
- Start interconnection application with PG&E as soon as possible due to long study timelines.
- Conduct a detailed wetlands and habitat assessment to determine if federal permits are triggered.
- Prepare a decommissioning plan for county approval.
- Coordinate with all agencies in parallel to minimize delays.
