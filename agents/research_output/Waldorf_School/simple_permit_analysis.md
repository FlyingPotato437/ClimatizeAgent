## Analysis

For a 28.08 MWac utility-scale solar project at 2190 Empire Grade, Santa Cruz, CA 95060, you will need the following permits and approvals:

1. Conditional Use Permit (CUP)

Estimated Overall Timeline:
- Permitting (CUP, CEQA, environmental): 12–24 months
- Interconnection studies: 18–36 months (can overlap)
- Building/electrical permits: 2–4 months (after land use approvals)
- Total development timeline (including studies, permitting, and interconnection): 36–48 months (3–4 years) from project initiation to construction start.

Recommendations:
- Begin site control, environmental studies, and interconnection pre-application immediately.
- Engage with Santa Cruz County Planning and local stakeholders early.
- Budget for rigorous environmental review and potential mitigation.
- Monitor CAISO/PG&E interconnection queue and capacity.
- Prepare for a 3–4 year development cycle before construction.
