**MEMORANDUM**

**To:** External Partners and Investors  
**From:** [Your Company Name], Solar Project Development Team  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Subject:** Development Memo – Napa Apartments Solar PV Project, 2611 1st Street, Napa, CA 94558

---

### 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Napa Apartments Solar PV Project  
- **Location:** 2611 1st Street, Napa, CA 94558  
- **System Size:** 52.48 MWac (52.48 MWdc)  
- **Technology:** Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules (SIL-410 HC+)  
- **Memo Content:** This memo summarizes key development considerations, including estimated generation, real estate, grid proximity, permitting, interconnection, costs, regulatory requirements, and risk factors for the Napa Apartments Solar PV Project.

---

### 2. Estimated Generation

**Assumptions:**  
- Single-axis tracking, bifacial modules  
- System losses: 14% (per NREL PVWatts default)  
- Tilt: Latitude (38.3°)  
- Azimuth: 180° (due south)  
- Source: [NREL PVWatts Calculator](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/)

**Annual Generation Estimate:**  
- **System Size:** 52,480 kWac  
- **Estimated Specific Production:** ~1,800 kWh/kWac/year (Napa, CA, single-axis tracking, NREL PVWatts)  
- **Annual Generation:** 52,480 kWac × 1,800 kWh/kWac = **94,464,000 kWh/year**  
- **Monthly Generation:** ~7,872,000 kWh/month (seasonal variation applies)  
- **Capacity Factor:** (94,464,000 kWh/year) ÷ (52,480 kW × 8,760 h) = **20.6%**  
- **Specific Production:** **1,800 kWh/kWac/year**

> **Note:** The provided annual production figure (87,180 kWh) appears to be a typo or miscalculation. For a 52.48 MWac system, annual generation should be in the range of 90–100 GWh.

| Community Support  | 6           | TBD; Napa is generally supportive but must confirm |
| Environmental Risk | 7           | Low flood/hail, but check for habitat/wetlands     |
| **Overall**        | **6.5**     | Favorable, but land cost and permitting are hurdles|

---

### 16. Concerns and Trends

- **Land Cost:** Napa County land is high-value; cost and alternative use pressure are significant.
- **Permitting:** CEQA and local review can be lengthy and require robust environmental studies.
- **Grid Access:** PG&E interconnection queue is congested; hosting capacity must be confirmed.
- **Environmental:** Potential for sensitive habitat or wetlands; diligence required.
- **Community:** Local support is generally positive for renewables but must be confirmed for this site.
- **Additional Diligence:**  
  - Confirm parcel ownership, zoning, and title  
  - Complete environmental and grid studies  
  - Engage early with county and utility stakeholders
