# Solar Project Permit Analysis

**Project Address:** 2611 1st Street, Napa, CA 94558
**System Size:** 52.48 MWac

## Analysis

For a 52.48 MWac solar project at 2611 1st Street, Napa, CA 94558, you will need the following key permits and approvals:

1. Conditional Use Permit – Napa County Planning Department
   - Timeline: 6–12 months (public hearings required)
2. CEQA Environmental Review – California State (via Napa County)
   - Timeline: 6–18 months (often concurrent with use permit)
3. Building & Electrical Permits – Napa County Building Department
   - Timeline: 2–4 months (after land use approval)
4. FAA Permit (Form 7460-1) – If within 5 miles of an airport
   - Timeline: 1–2 months
5. Wetlands/Waters Permit (Section 404) – US Army Corps of Engineers/EPA
   - Timeline: 3–6 months (if wetlands/waters are impacted)
6. Wildlife Permit – US Fish & Wildlife Service
   - Timeline: 3–6 months (if endangered species present)
7. Interconnection Approval – CAISO (for transmission) and/or PG&E (for distribution)
   - Timeline: 12–24 months (studies and queue process)
8. Decommissioning Plan Approval – Napa County (financial assurance required)
   - Timeline: Included in land use/building permit process

Estimated overall permitting and development timeline: 30–48 months (2.5–4 years), including site control, studies, permitting, interconnection, and construction. Permitting and CEQA review are typically the longest steps and can run in parallel with interconnection studies.

Recommendations:
- Begin with site control, preliminary environmental and grid studies, and early engagement with Napa County Planning.
- Initiate CEQA review and Conditional Use Permit application as soon as possible.
- Coordinate with PG&E and CAISO for interconnection queue placement.
- Conduct detailed site diligence (zoning, wetlands, endangered species) to identify any additional permit triggers.
- Budget for public hearings and potential community engagement, as agricultural land conversion may face scrutiny.
