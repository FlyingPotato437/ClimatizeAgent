**MY CRITICAL EVALUATION - TACTICAL REFINEMENTS:**

**Technical Merit Assessment:**

**ESSENTIAL (Must-Have for August):**
1. **Idempotency Pattern** - Absolutely critical. Azure Functions can retry, and this will cause data corruption without idempotency checks. This is non-negotiable for any production system.

**VALUABLE BUT RISKY (Timeline Impact):**
2. **Granular Progress Tracking** - Great for UX but adds significant complexity to every function. Risk of over-engineering the MVP.
3. **Complex Polling Strategy** - Sophisticated but may be overkill for initial implementation.

**CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:**

**Timeline Reality Check:**
- 6-7 weeks remaining with 4-person team
- Each tactical refinement adds 2-3 days of development time
- Risk of missing August deadline if we add too much complexity

**Production vs MVP Trade-offs:**
- Need to balance "good enough for August" vs "production-ready"
- Some refinements can be added post-launch

**RISK ASSESSMENT:**

**Critical Risks:**
1. **Without Idempotency**: Data corruption, duplicate processing, system instability
2. **With Too Much Complexity**: Missing August deadline
3. **Without Basic Error Handling**: System failures in production

**BALANCED SYNTHESIS - TIERED APPROACH:**

**TIER 1: ESSENTIAL FOR AUGUST (Non-negotiable)**
1. **Idempotency in Queue Functions** - Simple check: "has this step been completed for this run_id?"
2. **Basic State Management** - Simple status tracking (pending/processing/completed/failed)
3. **DLQ Processing** - Essential for production reliability

**TIER 2: VALUABLE FOR LAUNCH (If time permits)**
1. **Enhanced Progress Tracking** - Add after core functionality works
2. **Sophisticated Polling** - Start with simple 2-second polling, enhance later
3. **Detailed Error Messages** - Add after basic error handling works

**TIER 3: POST-LAUNCH IMPROVEMENTS**
1. **Granular Sub-step Tracking** - v2 feature
2. **Advanced Retry Logic** - Enhance after basic system proves stable
3. **Performance Optimizations** - After system is functionally complete

**REVISED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**

**WEEK 1: FOUNDATION**
- Replace `requests` with `httpx` 
- Implement Mock adapters
- Basic Azure Table Storage state (4 states only: pending/processing/completed/failed)
- Simple idempotency: check if run_id + step_name already exists

**WEEK 2-3: CORE FUNCTIONALITY**
- Feasibility analysis engine (simple rules)
- Frontend basic polling (2-second intervals, 5-minute timeout)
- DLQ processor for failed workflows

**WEEK 4-5: INTEGRATION & POLISH**
- Real API integration when available
- Enhanced error handling
- Basic progress indicators

**SIMPLIFIED STATE SCHEMA:**
```
PartitionKey: project_id
RowKey: run_id
Status: pending|processing|completed_viable|completed_non_viable|failed
CurrentStep: helioscope_fetch|feasibility_analysis|document_generation
LastUpdate: timestamp
ErrorDetails: string
Results: JSON (feasibility scores, documents, etc.)
```

**SIMPLIFIED IDEMPOTENCY:**
```python
def ensure_idempotent(run_id: str, step_name: str):
    # Check if this step was already completed
    state = get_state(run_id)
    if f"{step_name}_completed" in state.get('completed_steps', []):
        return False  # Skip execution
    return True  # Proceed with execution
```

**CRITICAL DECISION:**
Focus on delivering working core functionality by August rather than perfect engineering. The suggested tactical refinements are excellent engineering practices but risk scope creep that could jeopardize the deadline.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- Implement Tier 1 features for August (essential for stability)
- Plan Tier 2 features for immediate post-launch iteration
- Defer Tier 3 to later versions

This ensures we deliver a stable, working system by August while avoiding over-engineering that could delay delivery. The granular progress tracking and sophisticated polling can be added in the weeks following launch when the core system is proven to work.

**FINAL VALIDATION:**
Does this balance appropriately address production reliability while respecting the August constraint?
